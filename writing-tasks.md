### Writing task 1: Report writing

Academic Tests: Topics tend to be more academic in nature

If looking for a band above 7 you NEED to write beyond 150 words.
Depending on the task it could be 200, 250 or 300 words

There are 8 different types of graphics that can appear for Task 1
The Graphic could be a
- Table
- Line Graph
- Bar Graph
- Stacked Bar Graph
- Pie Chart
- Process Diagram
- A Map Diagram
- More than one graphic (could be a combination of any of the above)

Practice all question types before the exam


A good strategy is read Task 2 first, but do Task 1 first

20 to 25 mins for Task 1
35 to 40 mins for Task 2

#### What is the examiner looking for
- Mention all the key features
- A clear overview
- Data / Evidence from the graphic
- Make comparisons of the data
- No irrelevant or inaccurate information. Report what is given
- No personal opinions / information based on candidate knowledge. Report what is given
- More data mentioned the better, however keep to the limit and no misinformation.
- Don't mechanically report the data.
