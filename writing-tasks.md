### Writing task 1: Report writing

Academic Tests: Topics tend to be more academic in nature

If looking for a band above 7 you NEED to write beyond 150 words.
Depending on the task it could be 200, 250 or 300 words

There are 8 different types of graphics that can appear for Task 1
The Graphic could be a

- Line Graph

35 to 40 mins for Task 2
